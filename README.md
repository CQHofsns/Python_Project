# Python Project Text To Image
**_This is my very first post and project on GitHub Community._**	

## Summary:
Python_Project_Text_To_Image is a program that convert the content that you wrote on text file (.txt) into image format (.bmp, .png, .jpg). Not only just convert text, you can adjust font color and background right in your text, like this:

> <edit c:"**_font color here_**", b:"**_background color here_**">"**_Text content here_**"<@edit>

For example, I have put a example text in Text Folder. And here is its content:

And here is the result:
